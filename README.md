Following implementations can be seen in these labs:

Lab1: Viterbi Algorithm

Lab2: Temperature Sensors and LED display

Lab3: Accelerometer Sensor

Lab4: Multi-threads to operate all sensors simultaneously

Final project: Wireless transmission of data packets from one board to another, trajectory tracking and mapping of coordinates on LCD display

STM32F4 microprocessor board was used.
